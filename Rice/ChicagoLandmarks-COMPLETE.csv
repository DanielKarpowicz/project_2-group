The enormous amount of intentional memories created in front of my murals are so profound it should continually remind us that art is an extremely important part of our lives. People watch and document the process from start to finish and ultimately feel attached to the project. Art creates an emotional connection within us.

My desire to contribute something positive and worthwhile is so strong one might say art is what makes me feel human. This project was a great experience and example of why public art is so important. I wanted the community to be proud of something positive that belongs to them. To have it be a constant reminder to be bold; to flex the hustle; and to hopefully have the desire to create something;big or small.; THIS IS LAKEVIEW is funded by Special Service Area 27; whose mission is to support a vibrant local economy and high quality of life for the benefit of Lakeview businesses and residents by improving and enhancing public streets and spaces; creating memorable experiences; encouraging spending locally and promoting the neighborhood.

In order to capture the essence of this phrase; I portrayed a lush bouquet of Chrysanthemums; Roses; Echinacea; and prairie grasses. Each of these blooms can be found in the city and serves a purpose in the bouquet apart from making a beautiful arrangement. Chrysanthemums are Chicago''s official flower; so they are featured most prominently in the mural. Roses are universally recognizable and loved; but they were also Anne Hewlett Fuller''s favorite; and the bloom that the famous Chicagoan architect and designer Buckminster Fuller gave her in courtship. Echinacea and prairie grasses are both found growing wild in Chicago; a nod to the abundance of beautiful wild foliage in Illinois. The symbolic blooms coupled with the title of the piece honor the city''s close and nuanced relationship with nature.'""

After watching some of Luzia; I reflected on the massive red papel picado that was used to incubate the twirling dancer ascending in one of the scenes as flower petals fell. Upon first sight it immediately made me think of the many designs links that make up my grandma;s doilies. I allowed the connection to guide the process of the mural''s details. The dripping effect is a direct reflection of the water scenes and rather than make it a focal point; I wanted to create a subtle resemblance to the water while keeping it connected to my graffiti roots. Drips are common and often the most enjoyable parts of ink tags and natural spray paint abstracts when doing stylized letters. It is important for me to stay true to my Mexican & Graffiti culture for the two has been an integral part of my life and visual art form. I want to honor and elevate them in ways that don;t appropriate or erase the values or struggles that have endured through their evolution and survival.; The Magia de Luzia was curated and organized by Columbia College Chicago as part of the Wabash Arts Corridor Street Level Public Art Exhibition; and sponsored by Cirque du Soleil in honor of the production LUZIA in Chicago; Illinois."""
