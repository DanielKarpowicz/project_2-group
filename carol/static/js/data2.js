In explaining his choice of women; Kerry James Marshall said; “In the history of monuments you have very few that represent women; but in the history of Chicago you have very many women that played key roles in establishing culture here. . . . My idea was to make a Forest Rushmore acknowledging the contribution of 20 women who’ve worked to shape the cultural landscape of the city; past and present.” The mural; executed by Artist Jeff Zimmerman; consists of trees as totems decorated by the women’s faces on the bottom. Up above are the park-like treetops; birds; a yellow-and-blue sun; and a ribbon that floats throughout the mural. The cross-cultural; multi-generational list of women include (left to right) actress and cofounder of Dearborn Homes Youth Drama Workshop Cheryl Lynn Bruce; founder of Chicago Children’s Theatre Jacqueline Russell; former Chicago First lady and founder of After School Matters Maggie Daley; founder of the DuSable Museum of African American History Margaret Burroughs; founder of Little Black Pearl Monica Haslip; television host and producer Oprah Winfrey; poet Gwendolyn Brooks; former Chicago cultural affairs commissioner Lois Weisberg; actress/writer; and cofounder of Collaboraction theater; Sandra Delgado; journalist and writer Achy Obejas; founder of eta Creative Arts Foundation Abena Joan Brown; Poetry magazine founder Harriet Monroe; founder of Black Ensemble Theater Jackie Taylor; founder and Artistic director of Chicago Shakespeare Theater Barbara Gaines; former director of the Renaissance Society Suzanne Ghez; dancer and president of Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago Joan Gray; dancer; choreographer; and founder of Ruth Page Center for the Arts Ruth Page; writer Sandra Ciseneros; Artist and cofounder of the AfricCobra collective Barbara Jones-Hogu; Janes Saks; founder of Project & and the Ellen stone Belic Institute for the study of Women and Gender in the Arts and Media.

When seeking permission from then Alderman John Arena we were instructed to honor all the officers who died in the line of duty. Jill Arena designed the mural with all 540+ names; Cyd Smillies led the paint team with some community volunteers. The bagpipe dedication included 16th and 17th district officers and commanders; families of fallen officers; and dignitaries. Officers and families were invited to fill in the badge numbers of their fallen loved ones. This mural features an officer saluting and grieving woman with the image of officer Flisk in her tear."

'The central female figure; her hair flowing like waves; towers above the surrounding trees and buildings and in her reflected gaze; we see the horizon clear; blue; open and full of possibilities.'\""

People watch and document the process from start to finish and ultimately feel attached to the project. Art creates an emotional connection within us. It allows us to pay attention and to be connected to it and thus be connected with others. My desire to contribute something positive and worthwhile is so strong one might say art is what makes me feel human. This project was a great experience and example of why public art is so important. I wanted the community to be proud of something positive that belongs to them. To have it be a constant reminder to be bold; to flex the hustle; and to hopefully have the desire to create something;big or small.; THIS IS LAKEVIEW is funded by Special Service Area 27; whose mission is to support a vibrant local economy and high quality of life for the benefit of Lakeview businesses and residents by improving and enhancing public streets and spaces; creating memorable experiences; encouraging spending locally and promoting the neighborhood.

      description_of_artwork: "'URBS IN HORTO; Latin for ''City in a Garden;'' is the official city motto of Chicago. In order to capture the essence of this phrase; I portrayed a lush bouquet of Chrysanthemums; Roses; Echinacea; and prairie grasses. Each of these blooms can be found in the city and serves a purpose in the bouquet apart from making a beautiful arrangement. Chrysanthemums are Chicago''s official flower; so they are featured most prominently in the mural. Roses are universally recognizable and loved; but they were also Anne Hewlett Fuller''s favorite; and the bloom that the famous Chicagoan architect and designer Buckminster Fuller gave her in courtship. Echinacea and prairie grasses are both found growing wild in Chicago; a nod to the abundance of beautiful wild foliage in Illinois. The symbolic blooms coupled with the title of the piece honor the city''s close and nuanced relationship with nature.'\" URBS IN HORTO is part of the Lakeview Public Art Program; an initiative of Special Service Area 27 and its 501(c)(3) non-profit partner organization; Friends of Lakeview which showases original works of art by innovative artists throughout the West Lakeview neighborhood.

The design inspiration comes from my family heirlooms-'\"carpetas tejidas'\" the delicate and intricate original crocheted designs of my grandmother and great grandmother. After watching some of Luzia; I reflected on the massive red papel picado that was used to incubate the twirling dancer ascending in one of the scenes as flower petals fell. Upon first sight it immediately made me think of the many designs links that make up my grandma;s doilies. I allowed the connection to guide the process of the mural''s details. The dripping effect is a direct reflection of the water scenes and rather than make it a focal point; I wanted to create a subtle resemblance to the water while keeping it connected to my graffiti roots. Drips are common and often the most enjoyable parts of ink tags and natural spray paint abstracts when doing stylized letters. It is important for me to stay true to my Mexican & Graffiti culture for the two has been an integral part of my life and visual art form. I want to honor and elevate them in ways that don;t appropriate or erase the values or struggles that have endured through their evolution and survival.; The Magia de Luzia was curated and organized by Columbia College Chicago as part of the Wabash Arts Corridor Street Level Public Art Exhibition; and sponsored by Cirque du Soleil in honor of the production LUZIA in Chicago; Illinois."
